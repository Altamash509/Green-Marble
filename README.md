Green Marble: A Data-Driven Business Transformation

From Traditional Shop to Digital Enterprise
For over 30 years, my father has run a successful building-materials shop in Mumbai. Inventory management, pricing, and customer relationships were all handled the old-fashioned way—with memory and notebooks. As a data engineer, I couldn't help but see a world of potential.

MISSION
This project is the first step in a larger vision. I plan to eventually integrate live inventory, build comprehensive dashboards, and expand the business into new markets. It's a blend of a father’s hands-on legacy and a son's cloud-first mindset—a future in the making.
It's a commitment to use technology to scale a family legacy.

My goal is to create a business where:

Inventory data drives insights, not just physical records.

Orders are automated, not handled manually.

Pricing is optimized with data, not guesswork.

Growth is powered by real insights.

This project uses modern data engineering to bring an old-school business into the digital age.

Why This Matters
This project directly addresses the challenges faced by many traditional businesses, including my father's.

Challenge: No digital records for inventory or pricing.

Solution: Live product listings are scraped and cataloged digitally.

Challenge: Out-of-stock or overstock issues.

Solution: Key performance indicators (KPIs) like inventory turnover ratios are used to manage stock.

Challenge: No online presence.

Solution: A discoverable, SEO-friendly website is being built to attract new customers.

Tech Stack
I'm building this project with a modern tech stack to mirror a real startup environment.
